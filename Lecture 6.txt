// Boot Process Stages:

1. BIOS → Basic Input/Output Process - This BIOS initializes the hardware and makes sure that the hardware is good to go by running some power on tests/checks.

Main Job - It loads the 'boot loader'

2. Boot Loader - It loads the kernel into the memory.

GRUB Boot Loader is the 'Universal Linux Standard' and is one of the most common boot loaders. It is used to dual boot a system.

3. Kernel - Once the Kernel is loaded, it immediately initializes the memory and the devices in the system.

Main job - Load the init aka mother process

4. Init - Init process starts and stops all the essential processes that run our system. It runs and controls our system.


Linux OS can be classified into 3 levels/layers of abstraction:

1. Hardware - Includes CPU, memory, ports, hard disks, SSDs etc.
It is the physical layer that computes what our system is actually doing.

2. Kernel - Handles processes, manages memories, system calls etc.

3. User Space - Handles the shell running, graphics etc. Basicaaly what we see is handled by this layer.


Privilages of these different levels:

1. Kernel operates in 'Kernel Mode'
2. User operates in 'User Mode'

Kernel Mode - Kernel here has complete access to the hardware and it controls everything in the system.

User Mode - It is allowed access to a very small amount of safe memory and the CPU.

Basic operations like READ, WRITE, ACCESS, controlling some networking ports, etc.  basically anything hardware related is done in Kernel mode.

Both the User Mode and the Kernel Mode are also known as 'Privilage Levels / Protection Rings'

The hardware trusts the kernel more but does not trust the user much. Hence hardware shares everything with the kernel.


// System calls

It allows us as a user to perform some actions as the kernel mode, and then we switch back into the user mode.

While we are in the kernel mode (via system call), we can exchange information with the hardware as a user.

System calls aka 'Sys calls' make some services available to the user applications or user processes by using a 'System Call Api'.

The amount of services given out by the kernel thorough the APIs is fixed. We cannot add more to it.

Our system has a table containing different system calls, each system call having a 'Unique ID'.

The kernel knows which system call is sent to it, and what services to share it via the APIs by recognizing its 'Unique System Call ID'.



// 3 Implementations of INIT process

1. System V Implementation - Traditional Way

2. Upstart Implementation - Used earlier in Ubuntu.

3. System D Implementation - New Standard


♦ System V Implementation:

It starts and stops processes sequentially.

Advantage - Easier to resolve dependency issues.
eg. Let's have 2 Processes A and B, here process B is dependent on A. Therefore System V Implementation makes sure to start process A first and then process B to resolve this dependency issue.

Disadvantage - Performance is not that great as the processes are starting and stopping one at a time.

It does things one at a time and not simultaneously.

The status of the system while using System V Implementation is defined by 'runlevels'.

These runlevels are from 0 to 6.

0 → Shutdown
1 → Single User
2 → Multi User without networking 
3 → Multi User with networking 
4 → Unused / Idle
5 → Multi Users with networking and GUI
6 → Reboot

When a system starts, it checks which runlevel we are at currently and based on that runlevel's config, it executes all the necessary scripts.

* All our config exists in '/etc' directory.

** Do: "ls /etc/rc" then press "tab" multiple times.

-rc → run level config.

We see some directories listed.

** Now Do: "ls /etc/rc0" then press "tab" 2 to 3 times.

This shows us all scripts that are executed when run level is 0 i.e. shutdown.

We can also do "ls /etc/rc1", ...., "ls /etc/rc6"

Just press 'tab' here and not 'enter'.

** To check all system V services, do: "service --status-all"

** We can do: "sudo service (service name) start"
"sudo service (service name) stop"
"sudo service (service name) restart"

These commands can be used in other implementations also.


♦ Upstart Implementation: 

Developed by Canonical.

Uses Events and Jobs model.

It responds to an event as soon as it happens.

Jobs are the actions performed.

Events are the messages received from other processes that trigger the jobs.

** To see the list of all jobs along with their config, do: "ls /etc/init"

Press 'Tab' after this and we see that we have only one config and that is: whoopsie.conf

** Do: "cat /etc/init/whoopsie.conf" to see config of whoopsie.conf script.

We see:
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [!2345]

it means start if runlevels are 2,3,4,5

and stop if runlevels are not (!) 2,3,4,5 i.e. runlevels are 0,1,6.

How the Upstart Implementation works:

1. It loads up all the configs from /etc/init.

2. When the startup event occurs, it runs all the jobs that were triggered by that event.

3. This process of occuring of an event and running of the jobs triggered by that event happens in the form of a 'chain reaction' and it keeps on happening untill all the jobs are completed.


♦ System d Implementation:

It uses 'goals' to get your system up and running.

'Goals' are just some 'targets' that need to be achieved.

These 'targets' have some dependencies that also needs to be achieved.

This system is flexible and robust and it does not need to do things sequentially to get all the processes started.


How it works:

1. Loads up the config files.

** To get the config files, 
• do: "ls /etc/systemd/"
(press 'enter' here)

or 

• do: "ls /lib/systemd/system | less" 

Here there is a file called 'default.target', all the goals are inside this file.

Let's look at this file:

** do:
• "ls /lib/systemd/system/de" then press 'TAB'
• now: "cat /lib/systemd/system/default.target" then press 'ENTER'

It (this file) has all the info, that system needs to do on bootup.

It figures out all the dependencies that are there and starts activating them as they are.

Different Systemd Targets:

1. poweroff.target -> Shutdown
2. rescue.target -> Single User 
3. multi-user.target -> Multi User with Networking 
4. graphical.target -> Multi User with Networking and GUI 
5. reboot.target -> reboot 

graphical.target => default 

** To shut down the system, do: "sudo shutdown -h now" 

-h => poweroff or halt 

** To reboot the system, do: "sudo reboot"
